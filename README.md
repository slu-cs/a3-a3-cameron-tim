Citations:
  - looked up documentation for labeling input boxes. 

Does GitHub show that both partners contributed substantially to the code?
  - Yes.
  
Does the page allow a poll to be created with one question and multiple answers?
  - Syntax error on line 76 from a merge conflict has to be fixed first, but then yes.

After the poll has been created, does the page allow votes to be cast?
  - Vote buttons appear, but clicking them doesn't have an effect.

After votes have been cast, does the page allow them to be tallied?
  - This part appears to be unfinished.

Is the user interface intuitive and easy to use?
  - We'd be less likely to hit the submit button too soon if it were at the bottom.
  - The section about adding an option should probably go away too once we submit the poll.
  - It would be nice if the input boxes were longer so they could show more text at a time.

Is the page tolerably styled with Bootstrap?
  - Yes.
